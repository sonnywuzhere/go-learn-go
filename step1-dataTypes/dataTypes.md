# Step 1 - data types

1. What are the naming requirements for variables in Go?
   a. What about naming conventions? Are they enforced by the comiler/interpreter,
   or are they just standards in the community?

2. Is your language statically or dynamically typed?

3. Strongly typed or weakly typed?

4. If you put this line (or similar) in a program and try to print x,
   what does it do? If it doesn't compile, why? Is there something you can do to make it compile?
   x = "5" + 6

5. Describe the limitations (or lack thereof) of your programming language as they relate to
   the coding portion of the assignment (adding ints and floats, storing different types in lists,
   converting between data types). Are there other restrictions or pitfalls that the documentation
   mentions that you need to be aware of?

6. Are there built-in complex data types that are commonly used in your language? (hint: they'd
   probably appear fairly early in the documentation if so)
