# History of Go

• Go was created at Google in 2007 by Robert Grisemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike to
solve problems that they were facing at Google in their day-to-day work. Their goal was
“to improve programming productivity in an era of multi-core networked machines and
large codebases” (https://go.dev/solutions/google/), that is, they needed a language to
handle the big problems that the big servers and big databases at Google were causing the
engineers. https://go.dev/talks/2012/splash.article

• Go has an iconic mascot called the Go Gopher. The gopher was first created by Renee
French for the WFMU radio station in New Jersey for a t-shirt design for a fundraiser.
When Go was launched in 2009, Renee said the gopher should be the mascot for Go.

## Where Go is Used

### Cloud & network services (particularly at scale)

- Go helps with reliable concurrency in scaling cloud computing
- Building servers with Go is less expensive and faster
- GCP, AWS, Azure and other main cloud providers have Go APIs
- Highlights of companies using Go for their cloud & network services: Google Cloud,
  CapitalOne banking, Dropbox, Twitch, and Uber

### CLIs (Command-line Interfaces)

- Cloud & network services are usually CLI-based
- Go compiles quickly to a single binary and works with many different platforms
- Go has an instant startup time and Go programs don’t need other dependencies to run
- Highlights of companies using Go for CLIs: Github, Kubernetes, MongoDB, and
  Netflix

### Web development

- Go provides fast cross-platform deployment
- Better web performance because of concurrency and CPU scalability
- Go doesn’t need a web framework most of the time, but Go does has web frameworks,
  such as Echo, Flamingo, Gin, and Gorilla
- Highlights of companies using Go for web development: Cloudflare, Medium, Gov.uk,
  and Hugo

### Development Operations (DevOps) & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

- Go has fast built times, lean syntax, security support, and vast standard library that
  helps when building CLIs
- Go has a garbage collector to handle memory management
- Go has an automatic documentation generator
- Highlights of companies using Go for DevOps/SRE: Docker, IBM, Netflix, Microsoft,
  Terraform, and Youtube
